# Rock, Paper, Scissors

A classic, competitive game from childhood made with JavaScript. This project was made as part of The Odin Project.

## Functionality

The game is simple. The program will first ask you for your name. Next, you type in "rock", "paper" or "scissors" and then the computer will choose its option. If you win, you get 1 point. If it's a tie, no one gets a point. The first player to reach 5 points wins the game.

## Releases
* V1.0 - The game is playable using the DevTools Console on Chrome or other browsers
* Future Releases - Add UI, interactivity and more features to the HTML page
